# stock-analysis
This sheet Stock Analysis consists of all the skill drills covered as part of the study assessment
### Purpose of this assessment
Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.
### Personal insights on Assessment <br/>
The project challenge is focused to help in learning the importance of thinking on new dimensions within the same problem space and also to focus on code refactoring, which is usually lesser priority in the development circle due to project timelines. <br/>
The initial run of the program took few milliseconds more as the first run the resources need to be allocated. The run for 2017 and 2018 years has been 0.26 and 0.36 sec. From the data perspective it is the same volume of data 3013 lines in 8 column values. However, the processed time in between the 2 runs is significant. <br/>
  This analysis would help in understanding the importance of Code Refactoring.
  
  ### Results
  The stock ticker in consideration DQ has not performed well in the past 2 years. For both the years of 2017 and 2018 it has performed negatively. <br/>
  The performance has been clearly articulated in the VBA_Challenge macro-based excel sheet which also show cases the time taken to execute the data. As, the time taken to process the transactions is 0.26 and 0.36 sec respectively which is captured in the screenshots <br/>

  ### Summary
  From the end user perspective, like Steve's parents this amount of information would suffice as that would help them to understand if the stock performance has been good or not. However, from Steve's perspective to make more meaningful decisions and to take the right steps forward the data has to be more providing more data points and insights. <br/>
  The refactored code helped in getting the output in a faster pace and also would help in decision making.
